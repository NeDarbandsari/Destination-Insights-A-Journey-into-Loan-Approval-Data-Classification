This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook file that implies the use of Random Forest and Desicion Tree algorithms for loan approval prediction. In the pursuit of building a robust model for loan approval, this project focuses on analyzing a comprehensive dataset obtained from Kaggle. The dataset encapsulates 13 features and over 4000 instances, providing essential insights into loan applicants' backgrounds and attributes. The dataset, stored in CSV format, can be accessed from the Kaggle repository: Loan Approval Prediction Dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/architsharma01/loan-approval-prediction-dataset?select=loan_approval_dataset.csv.![image](https://github.com/NeDarbandsari/Classification-Project/assets/154226728/130c49f0-6c04-4d3d-bbfc-4e1e51997320)
